Context: a bride is being prepared for a wedding.\\footnote{In view of the ethnological reports about Na family structure reviewed in Appendix B (Section sec:anthropologicalresearchthefascinationofnafamilystructure), it may come as a~surprise that there should be folk stories about weddings in Yongning. Arranged marriages and difficult relationships between brides and mothers\"=in\"=law are typical of Confucian cultures (see e.g.~{rileyInterwoven1994, chanviolence2008}), not of pre-1950s Yongning. But the argument of a~story's fit to a~particular culture runs both ways: a~tale can be appealing because it resonates with one's cultural background, or on the contrary, it can gain appeal from exoticism. The 1990s soap opera Ke Wang h{\u6e34\u671b} (\u2018Yearnings\u2019), which was a~roaring success throughout China (wangkewang1992: a~phenomenon studied by), was also popular in Yongning, where the Na gathered at the homes of television owners to watch the story of Liu Huifang, the ideal daughter\"=in\"=law (this is narrated by F4 in the document entitled Evenings). Part of the soap opera's appeal to a~Na audience may have been due to the novelty of the social relationships that it stages. A~young Naxi woman from the Lijiang plain explained to me in 2010 that she loved watching Chinese soap operas \u201cto see how Han people live\u201d, i.e. out of curiosity for cultural habits which she sees as different from Naxi custom. A~study in comparative mythology and folklore in this area of the Himalayas would be necessary to trace the origin and development of stories such as that of the unhappy daughter\"=in\"=law who gets buried alive, a~story also known to Laze consultant F7 (the Laze version is also available online). The thrills and spills of this story make it a~good candidate for adoption by anyone who likes a~good yarn.})": {

The woman who was accused of adultery in this case became pregnant at a time when she was living mainly apart from her husband, during which, as they both agreed, they had had sex between three and six times.
